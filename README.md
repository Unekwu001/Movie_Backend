# Movie_Backend
A Backend service that connects to an external movie api

Assessment
Using http://www.omdbapi.com service API, create a web application 
with the following functionality:
-Movie search by title
- Saving 5 latest search queries
- Showing search results
- Show extended movie information when a particular movie is selected 
(poster, description, IMDB score etc)
Please use DotNet core as a backend and React as a frontend framework, 
if possible. 
In case you feel more comfortable with another frontend framework, that 
is totally acceptable as well.
If possible, please add unit tests too.
